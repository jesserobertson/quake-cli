# quake-cli

A modern Python library for querying earthquake data from the GeoNet API

## Features

- üåç **GeoNet API Integration** - Query real-time earthquake data from New Zealand's GeoNet service
- ‚ö° **Async Performance** - Fast async HTTP client with automatic retries and error handling
- üîç **Flexible Filtering** - Filter earthquakes by magnitude, MMI, location, and time
- üìä **Type-Safe Data Models** - Pydantic models for reliable earthquake data structures
- üîÑ **Result-Based Error Handling** - Functional error handling with composable Result types
- üöÄ **Modern Python 3.12+** - Uses latest Python features with comprehensive type hints
- üìñ **Tested Examples** - All documentation examples are automatically tested for accuracy

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install quake_cli
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from quake_cli.client import GeoNetClient
from logerr import Ok, Err

async def get_earthquakes():
    async with GeoNetClient() as client:
        # Get recent earthquakes
        result = await client.get_quakes(limit=5)

        match result:
            case Ok(response):
                for quake in response.features:
                    props = quake.properties
                    print(f"M{props.magnitude:.1f} at {props.locality}")
            case Err(error):
                print(f"Error: {error}")

asyncio.run(get_earthquakes())
```

**Example Output:**
```
M5.2 at 20 km north-east of Seddon
M4.8 at 15 km south of Kaikoura
M3.9 at 25 km west of Wellington
M4.1 at 10 km east of Christchurch
M3.7 at 30 km north of Dunedin
```

### Filtering and Search

```python
import asyncio
from quake_cli.client import GeoNetClient
from logerr import Ok, Err

async def filter_earthquakes():
    async with GeoNetClient() as client:
        # Filter by magnitude
        result = await client.search_quakes(min_magnitude=4.0, limit=3)

        match result:
            case Ok(response):
                print(f"Found {response.count} large earthquakes")
                for quake in response.features:
                    props = quake.properties
                    print(f"M{props.magnitude:.1f} - {props.locality}")
            case Err(error):
                print(f"Error: {error}")

asyncio.run(filter_earthquakes())
```

**Example Output:**
```
Found 15 large earthquakes
M5.2 - 20 km north-east of Seddon
M4.8 - 15 km south of Kaikoura
M4.1 - 10 km east of Christchurch
```

## GeoNet API

This tool queries earthquake data from [GeoNet](https://www.geonet.org.nz/), New Zealand's geological hazard information system. GeoNet provides real-time earthquake monitoring and data for New Zealand and surrounding areas.

**Data Attribution**: Earthquake data provided by GeoNet (https://www.geonet.org.nz/)
